# TechTest

## Introduction

TechTest is a mobile app that allows users to explore characters from the "Rick and Morty" TV series. 

This project serves as a demonstration of various software development concepts and techniques, made within a day as a Test.

## Key Features

- Browse and view character details.
- Perform searches based on character names.
- Efficiently load and display data asynchronously.
- Implement pagination for large datasets.
- Handle errors and display visual alerts.
- Utilize VIP architecture and design patterns.
- Perform unit testing to ensure code quality.

## Technologies

- Developed in Swift
- UIKit for the main screen user interface.
- SwiftUI for the detail screen user interface.
- URLSession for making API requests.
- Caching responses and Images.
- XCTest for unit testing.

## Project Structure

The project follows the VIP (View, Interactor, Presenter) architecture pattern. It is organized into the following main components:

- **View**: User interface components implemented in SwiftUI and UIKit.
- **Interactor**: Handles data retrieval and business logic.
- **Presenter**: Manages data presentation and UI updates.

In addition to these core components, the project also includes:

- **Storage Manager**: Manages local storage and caching.
- **API Manager**: Handles network requests and interactions with external APIs.

## Design Guidelines

The user interface and design of this app have been developed following the [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/).

I have adhered to Apple's design principles to ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience. This approach aligns with the best practices recommended by Apple for iOS app design.
